      <p>Biologists need computational tools that are easily scalable, customizable, and modular. I am moved by the concept of creating and accumulating all of the data gathering, formatting, and analysis modules that a particular lab might need such that even less computer-savvy researchers can easily customize their own workflows to do exactly what they want. Therefore, one of my main research interests is the development of robust, easy-to-use, open-source bioinformatic software</p>
      <p>I have several open-source coding projects of various sizes hosted on GitHub. Most are related to bioinformatics, while others are just fun side projects.<!--  Below are descriptions for some of them. --></p>
